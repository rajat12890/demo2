## 🌐 **Public GitHub Repository URL for Apache 2.0 LICENSE File**

Here’s a *public GitHub repo* that contains a top-level `LICENSE` file under **Apache License 2.0** (with all required sections like Definitions, Redistribution, Patent Grant, etc.):

🔗 **https://github.com/LGE-OSS/example** — contains an `Apache-2.0` LICENSE file in the repository root. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

> This is a standard example repository with a publicly visible Apache 2.0 license file in the root.

If you want, I can also include **the full Apache 2.0 LICENSE text** or explain each section (e.g., Patent Grant, Limitation of Liability, etc.).
::contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
